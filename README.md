This repository contains examples from decades of work on intelligent databases going back to the Eighties.  It is intended to show how AI has been used through the years, both the changes and the perenial issues.  I've seen AI ice-ages come and go, along with all the winds of hype. Many things stay the same, errors repeated and new challeges presented.

Included below are some artifacts from these times.  From these excursions into the data landscape, I have attempted to create a travelogue of various paths' highlights and potential pitfalls. These I have included these as LESSONS LEARNED, highlighting elements where I went astray, was misled by the hyperboles of the day, or was influenced by other factors (including my own stupidity!).  Hype has always been the bugbear of AI.

As with databases, perennial problems (like silo-formation) emerge in different forms as different technologies take shape, AI must keep in mind where methodological error can creep in.  I hope the lessons I learned can help others in the field.
