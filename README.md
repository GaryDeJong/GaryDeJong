This repository contains some examples from decades of work on intelligent databases going back to the Eighties.  I've seen many AI ice-ages come and go, along with the periodic winds of hype.  Also the AI deserts inbetween causing a lot of heat (and mirages).

Code examples and documentation are included in the folders to show the thought processes involved as data science technologies expanded.  From these excursions into the data landscape, I have attempted to create a travelogue of various paths' highlights and potential pitfalls. Thess I have included these as LESSONS LEARNED, highlighting elements where I went astray, was misled by the hyperboles of the day, or was influenced by other factors (including my own stupidity!).
