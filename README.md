This repository contains some examples from decades of work on intelligent databases going back to the Eighties.  I've seen AI ice-ages come and go, along with all the winds of hype.  The AI deserts in between caused a lot of heated exchanges (and mirages).

Included below are some artifacts from these times.  From these excursions into the data landscape, I have attempted to create a travelogue of various paths' highlights and potential pitfalls. These I have included these as LESSONS LEARNED, highlighting elements where I went astray, was misled by the hyperboles of the day, or was influenced by other factors (including my own stupidity!).

As with databases, perennial problems (like silo-formation) emerge in different forms as different technologies take shape, AI must keep in mind where methodological error can creep in.
